# Our Greatest Fear 
*Marianne Williamson*

It is our light not our darkness that most frightens us

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.<br />

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.<br />
It is our light not our darkness that most frightens us.<br />
We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous,<br />
talented and fabulous?

Actually, who are you not to be?<br />
You are a child of God.<br />
Your playing small does not serve the world.<br />
There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other<br />
people won't feel insecure around you.

We were born to make manifest the glory of
God that is within us.

It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone.<br />
And as we let our own light shine,<br />
we unconsciously give other people<br />
permission to do the same.

As we are liberated from our own fear,<br />
Our presence automatically liberates others.
